                <h1>Journal 1: 3D printing</h1>
                <p class="lead">ENGR11 Meiyi Duan</p>
                <p> I printed my name tag and a Pochita Keycap. When I started printing the name tag, I first changed my name in the Prusa model, and I clicked to “slice” it. Then I output the code into an USB. I filled out one print job number and wrote down a print job number on a sticky note and attached it to the printer. Then I chose to let the 3D printing machine start preheating. The material that I am using is PLA. After the machine reaches the right temperature, I purge and see if the color is right. The first problem appeared when I chose my file. I think I have outputted the wrong file type and the printer just froze after I clicked my file. After restarting the printer and copying the right file type into the USB, I started printing. It went smooth, and changing color is also a fun part. I did not realize that the program would automatically ask me to change color, I thought I have to pause and switch at some point myself. When the printer finished building the base of the name tag, it asked me to change color. I think the overall process is pretty smooth and successful and I did not run into big problems while printing.</p>

                <p>My second printing is a Pochita Keycap. I found the model on https://thangs.com/. I downloaded the file and “sliced” it.The whole process lasts 28 minutes and the first problem that I run into is also the file type problem. When I inserted the USB and chose the file on the printer, the printer showed that file type does not match. I went back to PrusaSlicer and I learned that when I export a file I have to choose the printer setting,  printer type and the materials that I am printing(PLA). I did not chosen the right material and printer type therefore it runs into an error. It should be PLA for the material, and Prusa MINI for the printer. After I exported the new file, it worked successfully. After it finished, I realized that since it is such a small keycap with lots of details that the tail part is not really working. It has two pieces where I have to attach the tail through the hole but I don’t see the hole printed, I think it sticks to the other parts. Also there are a lot of strings. I think in future printing, choosing the material is important, when doing small and precise printing maybe PLA is not a perfect choice because small parts may stick together and strings may appear, and also maybe thinking about doing it on a larger scale.
