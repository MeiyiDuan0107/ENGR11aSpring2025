                    On https://thangs.com/ I found two models, the first one is a cat shaped jewelry box and the other is a snack bowl with four compartments. I decided to use the cat head shape as the lid and the snack bowl as the bottom to create a bowl with a lid. After downloading them into stl files, I imported them into tinkercad.

                    First I changed the size of the lid and the bowl. Since they are two circle shapes, I changed their diameter to match the lid to the bowl into 120. I also modified how deep the bowl is, I changed it into 80. I wanted to add something into the bowl body so I just used one of the shapes in tinkercad and added a star shape on the bowl body. I rotated, and changed the size and angle of the star and I used the “align” tool to match the height and align them to the center of the bowl body. Then I used the “group” tool to make the star actually attached to the bowl and make them one model together. 
                    I am thinking if printing them together will be risky and don’t know if the printer is capable of doing that, I decided to print the lid and the bowl separately. I first exported the bowl intp Prusa Slicer and sliced it. After copying the G-code on the USB, I went to a printer and started preheating. The first thing that I run into is the PLA material is not loading. I tried several times and also I decided on a new roll of PLA material because it will use up 172.12grams of PLA material(according to PrusaSlicer) because I am afraid the original roll will not be enough to print the bowl. After the bowl was printed out, I printed the cat head the other day, both of the printing jobs lasting about 8 hours.

                    The prints went well, I worried about the stability problem where the cat eye will fall but it turns out it worked. I am thinking of changing the supporting cylinder part. I want to make it light but still support the inner head, but not look so heavy and use a lot of materials.

                    I imported the original cat head file and imported the bowl file but with the star added on the body. The main thing that I want to solve is to add something to support the cat head so it does not have a stability problem. Fusion does not have many basic shape models that I can use directly, so I started adding a cylinder. I tried twice with the cylinder. For the first try, I used the “chamfer” tool but I selected the upper instead of the lower surface so that I have to make it upside down. I got lost when I needed to change the size of the surface circle of the cylinder so I started with a new one. The second try I ended up drawing under the cat head therefore I can sketch a circle that matches the inner side of the cat head. I also modified the height of the cylinder so that it matches the inner side of the cat head. Next I used the “chamfer” tool to make it look like a circular cone but with two circular surfaces(one supported from the ground the other is attached to the inner cat head). The second question that I ran into was combining the circular cone with the cat head. I found that the cat head I imported is only in a mesh body(same as the bowl), and it is not letting me combine a mesh body with a solid body together. Therefore I searched for how to convert a mesh body to a solid body, it turns out that in the “Mesh” tab, I can select “modify” and “convert mesh” and then I can change it into a solid body and combine it. I saved the file and copied it into the Prusa Slicer. I made the scale smaller so that I will not print for so long and can test if the supporting circular cone is working. The printing process lasts about 5 hours.

                The print went well and the inner design worked successfully supporting the inner cat head. The head and the bowl fit together.
