                    For this project, I learned how to solder first. Soldering is a process that joins metal components using a molten alloy (solder). Begin by ensuring a clean, well-ventilated workspace. Heat the soldering iron to the appropriate temperature (typically 300–400°C) and clean its tip with brass wool. Apply a small amount of solder to the tip to improve heat transfer. Hold the iron against both the component lead and the circuit pad for 1–2 seconds to heat them, then touch the solder wire to the joint—not the iron—allowing it to melt and flow smoothly. Remove the solder and iron, letting the joint cool naturally. A good joint appears shiny and smooth, while a dull or lumpy one indicates a weak “cold joint” needing rework. Always secure components and avoid prolonged heating to prevent damage. Clean the tip after use and power off the iron safely. When I first tried, I could not control the right time of heating the wire which would eventually burn and break the wire. 

                    Before I begin, I have read the entire instruction manual step by step. After I read the manual, I think soldering components like resistors, LEDs, and the LM393 IC requires precision to avoid overheating or damaging parts, especially given the strict 1-second soldering time limit. Differentiating resistor values (e.g., "510hm" likely meaning 510Ω) and ensuring correct polarity for LEDs and capacitors could lead to errors due to unclear labeling or typos in the manual. Mechanical assembly steps, such as aligning gears, axles, and photoresistors at specific heights (5mm for sensors, 14mm for LEDs), demand careful measurement and spatial reasoning, which may be challenging. So me and my partner decided that while he focuses on soldering, I focus on finding the right part and where to put it, and also fixing the parts that are not correctly functioning. Installing the Photoresistors is challenging because they should be installed on the other side  and also need to have a height of about 5mm. Luckily we did not build anything wrong, and the car performed about average, but only when it met a 90 degree angle, it would not recognize the correct route and start to drive in circles. One more important thing is that we found the wheel sometimes does not touch the motor, which makes the car freeze sometimes. Because the wheels miss the motors sometimes, I tried to adjust the black screws attached to the motor which move the motor and wheels closer and touch each other. Here’s my measurements of the car:

                </div>
                    <p>Unfortunately we have some problems with the collaborative project space in Autodesk Fusion, we can only create like a shared folder(like google drive) and we can only download to make changes to the file and re-upload when we are done, but this could not seen in the Fusion app and we could not see the real time changes. I asked my teammate to build together with me in Fusion and he said his software crashed and could not work, therefore I was doing the whole design in Fusion and my teammate did not contribute to this part, only suggestions.
                    I used my own measurements for the design. So I started from drawing the base in the draft. Instead of doing just a box, I want to do something that has a round head and back, which makes it more challenging. I want it to look like a car shape, therefore on the draft I have to draw a rectangle with rounded edges. I labeled my measurements in my draft. I have used both x y and z planes in order to draw the base, the side and the front of the car. The base part is basically cutting the space where I can change the batteries and press the power button. For the sides I designed the shape of the car, and for the front I have to cut out two holes(tunnels) for the LED lights. I also designed a surface which will be placed beside the LEDs which gives a support of the front head. Here’s my building process:

                    The first PLA print (black color) came out being unsuccessful because I could not get the support materials out, and I did not cut out the tunnels for the LEDs. So I added the tunnel by cutting out two solid cylinders. </p>

                    The second PLA print (white color) was ideally what I wanted to design. I have the perfect spaces for the front, and I have the holes cut out for the LEDs. I also have a nice cover for the back of the car. The only thing that I need to modify is that in the Fusion building process, sometimes I like to use “surface” instead of “solid”, which makes the car surfaces not sticking to each other very well. There are some gaps between each surface but besides this the car shell is what I wanted to build.</p>

                    The third PLA print (pink color) is not successful as well. We used organic support materials and at first I chose to use it because I thought it would not only provide good support but also be easy to take off, however, I cannot take the support materials off. The other changes I made for the third try is I have made the surfaces thicker, in order to make them stick to each other better than the second try. I have also made the front surface higher, because I don’t want the car model to touch the electrolytic capacitors. In the draft I drawed a larger circle which makes it have more space for the front areas.

                    I followed the video tutorials about how to build a finger joint box in Fusion. I love the part where I can directly change the parameters and therefore modify the box, instead of changing the draft and design, which is more convenient. I remeasured and used the measurements from the PLA prints for the parameters and I input it in the finger joint box. I exported the draft of the surfaces from Fusion into Lightburn, two long sides, two short sides and one base. For my first print I used acrylic ast the material. </p>

                    The first print did not fit on the car after I glued the parts together because I forgot to add the length of the tab. Therefore I reassured the car and changed the parameters in Fusion. I also added a window on the base surface, which makes changing batteries and pressing the power button available. I exported it again to Lightburn. </p>

                    The second print did not go well, it ended up larger than the car and it is staying on the car because the body parts are holding the box. Also for the materials I used wood instead of acrylic, and I forgot to cut out windows for the LEDs. I really hoped that I could redesign the laser cut print but I ran out of time.

                    From this project, I learned how to use and discovered a lot of functions in Fusion360. I think it teaches me a design process where I started from a 2D draft and then stretched it to a 3D part. Personally, I learned that for printing, building a “solid” and a “surface” DOES matter because the surface is empty inside and does not stick to each other very well. For Prusa Slicer, I think choosing the right style of support materials is REALLY important, also adjusting the amount and how the support materials lay out. For Laser cuts, I think measuring the right parameters is important.
