                    <h3>Part 1: Review documentation for the Open Source Hardware</h3>
                </div>
                    <p>For the documentations, the first thing I noticed is that they did not say about what parts do we need and how many do we need. For example, in the written assembly manual, they listed out that we need different and multiple snap pins. But besides the snap pins, we need multiple finger tips, multiple finger phalanx, two wrist pin caps and so on. It took me some time to find what the exact numbers of parts needed and took me multiple times to print and wait. The YouTube video likely provides a visual step-by-step demonstration, which can be highly beneficial for understanding complex assembly processes. Video tutorials showed motion-based actions, such as how to properly fit components together or tighten screws at the right angles. Additionally, they can be easier to follow for beginners, as they reduce the need for interpretation of written instructions. However, when I was doing the strings, I watched the video tutorials just to make sure I am doing the right thing. The video did not clearly show how to do the strings, I think they should record it in a different angle, where I can clearly see which hole and where exactly should the strings go. On the other hand, the PDF assembly guide offers a structured, detailed, and text-based reference that can be easily skimmed for specific steps. It included precise measurements, lists of required tools, and written step-by-step instructions. When I was doing the string part, I was totally confused by the PDF instructions. I don’t think it has clear descriptive instructions which I can easily follow, instead I am confused and I have to refer to the video guide. Something that I think they could design a better process to find the files and document the build steps is that creating links. For example, they could use QR codes or links in the PDF guide to link a video tutorial in each step or even link the STL files. They could also do an interactive online guide with clickable step-by-step animations, embedded videos or gifs to clearly show the process. A hybrid documentation approach that includes structured written instructions with visual aids (images, GIFs, or video snippets) would improve clarity. An interactive assembly guide with step-by-step animations would also make it easier to follow along without constantly rewinding a video or flipping through multiple pages of a PDF.

                    <h3>Part 2: 3D Print & assemble the model</h3>
                </div>
                    <p>
                    I downloaded all the parts needed into a zip file. In prusa slicer, arrangement and how parts layout is important because in order to print, we need to keep the parts with the raft away from each other. I have to constantly check between the layout and the sliced lay out to see if there’s any overlap. My whole progress was slower than expected because my teammate from project 3 ended up using three printers at the same time therefore there’s not printer available and I did not get to print any of the parts. When we have to find new teammates for the next class, I have to start over and start to print. 

                    For printing settings: first select “generate support material”, then for the raft section, select “raft layers” and set it to 3, select “raft contact Z distance” and set to 0.15, select “raft expansion” and set to 3. For options for support materials and raft section, set style to “snug” and pattern to “honeycomb”, also select yes for “support on build plate only”. </p>

                    We took a lot of time taking off the raft support materials, especially for the bigger parts. Assembly process went well, we mainly followed each step in the PDF guide. First we identified all the parts, and laid them out to see if we have the correct amount. I ended up printing only one wrist pin so I have to print another one while building the hand. The only thing that is confusing is stringing the fingers. We only have the elastic wires and I found out that after I tied it, it still cannot bend. I also found out that I have put the wires in the wrong holes, therefore I have to fix it and also change the materials for the strings. For the second try we used knitting wool thread. It worked perfectly fine but because it is soft, it took me some time to get it through the holes, sometimes it’s just stuck and will not go all the way through.

                    When we finished building, we realized that the hand does hold and bend but it is hard to hold small things. Therefore we wanted to add something that can help the hand to catch small things. We wanted to build a “fork” that is easy to use and wear. We wanted to make it into a ring attached with a fork therefore it is easy to wear and use. We could also make other tools instead of a fork, but with the ring design, I think it will all work well, just attach other tools to the ring. It will also be easy to change the tools needed, if you don’t need the tool, you can just take the ring off or replace it with another tool you need.

                    The project involving the development of prosthetic hands, such as those created through the e-NABLE organization, highlights the power of rapid prototyping in transforming lives. The process of designing and fabricating prosthetics is not just about functionality but also about inclusivity and empowerment. As seen in What Can a Body Do? How We Meet the Built World by Sara Hendren, language and identity play a crucial role in shaping the experiences of individuals with disabilities. Amanda, for example, chooses to use the term "disabled", emphasizing the reality of her interaction with a world not designed for her body. This perspective aligns with the mission of e-NABLE, which seeks to bridge the gap between the built world and those who don’t easily match its design. e-NABLE is a volunteer-driven global movement that leverages 3D printing technology to create affordable, customizable prosthetic hands. Unlike traditional prosthetic development, which can be costly and time-intensive, rapid prototyping allows for fast iteration, customization, and accessibility. This aligns with the themes in the passage, where Amanda's experience underscores how crucial adaptability and user-centered design are in assistive technology.
                    The task of designing a prosthetic hand is not just a technical challenge—it is also a social and ethical endeavor. As the passage highlights, the goal of assistive technology is not merely to “fix” a person’s condition but to integrate their lived experiences into solutions that empower them. Amanda’s perspective forces nondisabled individuals to reconsider their assumptions about disability, emphasizing that the world itself is what creates barriers. In my opinion, the impact of rapid prototyping in prosthesis development include: 1. Reducing cost (3d printing is cheaper and traditional prosthetics can cost a lot of money). 2. Customization and accessibility (use 3D design and printing, we could modify and change the design to fit an individual's need). To me a key takeaway from both the e-NABLE movement and the passage is that prosthetic development is about more than just mechanics—it is about understanding the human experience. The language Amanda uses to describe herself challenges us to rethink how assistive technology should be framed. Instead of focusing solely on making someone fit the world, we should also consider how the world can be reshaped to accommodate diverse bodies.
